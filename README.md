Technical Choices
1. Laravel (Backend):

    Framework: Laravel is used for the backend to handle routing, database operations, and RESTful API.
    Database: Uses a MySQL or SQLite database to store the game results and leaderboard data.
    Authentication: Laravelâ€™s built-in authentication system can be used if needed for user-specific game records.

2. SweetAlert2 (Frontend Alerts):

    SweetAlert2 is used to show visually appealing popups for announcing game results (win, draw) and showing the leaderboard.

3. JavaScript (Game Logic):

    Vanilla JavaScript is used to handle the gameplay logic, such as tracking turns, detecting wins, and handling button interactions.
    Event Listeners are added to handle player moves and update the UI accordingly.

4. Blade Templating (Frontend):

    The front-end uses Blade templating engine, which integrates seamlessly with Laravel. The layout is designed for both desktop and mobile screens, using simple HTML and CSS.

5. CSS:

    Basic styling is provided in the assets/styles/style.css file. It ensures the game layout is responsive and visually appealing across devices.

<h4>How to Play:</h4>

    Open the game in your browser.
    Click on any empty spot on the 3x3 grid to place your mark ("X" or "O").
    The game will automatically check if there is a winner or a draw after each move.
    After the game ends, you can view the leaderboard by clicking the Consult Leaderboard button.
